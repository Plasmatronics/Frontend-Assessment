# FRONTEND INTERVIEW ASSESSMENT

## How to Run Project (Vite)

To run the file.:
Install Packages via: **npm i**

THEN...
development version: **npm run dev**
build version: **npm run build**

## Approach to Component Reusability

### My Method

The way I see it there are two approaches to component reusability:\
a). have discriminator types that determine what will render... e.g...

```tsx
function superAwesomeButton({ variation }: { type: "success" | "error" }) {
  if (variation === "error") {
    <Button
      bg="red.600"
      color="white"
      _hover={{ bg: "red.700" }}
      _active={{ bg: "red.800" }}
    ></Button>;
  }
  if (variation === "success") {
    <Button
      bg="green.600"
      color="stone"
      _hover={{ bg: "green.700" }}
      _active={{ bg: "green.800" }}
    ></Button>;
  }
}
```

b). We can take a more manual approach where we open a more expansive API and allow components to call upon this api with certain settings...\

```tsx
interface ChatProps {
  icon: keyof typeof ChakraIcons;
  text: string;
  color?: AllChakraColors;
  isChat?: boolean;
}

export default function SidebarTask({
  icon,
  text,
  color = "gray.900",
  isChat = true,
}: ChatProps) {
  return (
    <Link
      paddingX={3}
      paddingY={2.5}
      _hover={{
        background: isChat ? "gray.400" : undefined,
      }}
    >
      <IconComponent boxSize={4} color={color} />
      <Text as="h4" fontWeight="semibold" color={color}>
        {text}
      </Text>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

In this project I opted for this latter approach, as you can see throughout the project, for two reasons:\
1). I think chakra already serves the job of creating components with a more broad variation descriminator\
2). I like having full manual control of the interface that i can open up. For this project I can make it specific to my exact needs\

### What Determined if Something Becomes a "Reusable Component"

I made components reusable (ie. has an interface with custom settings through which we can call upon) if they fit one of two criteria\
1). I was going to use something more than once AND the things I would use them on were close enough in styling\
2). I foresee the potential for this to be used more in the future.\

This means that something like the side chats were made super reusable because they have the potential to duplicate, while the "Welcome to FenceGPT" heading was not because there is no forseeable duplication of such a component.\

This also means that, even though the tab button and the buttons in the searchbar were similar, I did NOT make a reusable component for this purpose as they are not similar enough. This would simply be too much work for too little payoff.\

## Organization

There are 4 main folders: components, databse, pages, hooks and utils/
_database:_ I Chose to include a fake database to keep data seperate from UI logic and because this is more similar to how we would actually be rendering components, through accepting data from an abstracted source then rendering in a reusable component where we can then style everything.(likely something more similar to JSON but this is no matter).\

_pages:_ This is PURELY AN ASSEMBLY PAGE, no logic will be placed here. I could have left this page out, but this is more similar to how i would structure an actual project and I always like to have an assmebly page free of any state or anything like that.\

_utils:_ These are full of "helper" functions, or things we generally want to use all over the application but they dont actually do anything (they are very pure). This is filled with types, the theme, color alteration functions, and even a (very) small config file.\

_components_: This is where all the meat is. I have a sub folder for the aside and then one for the main page, then a file not in either folder that is used for the layout. Again, I could have done this in the page folder but there would have had to have been state there, which is a no no for me personally.\

_hooks_: A seperate folder to create hook logic that will be helpful throughout our app and that we want to keep seperate.\

_context_: A seperate folder to create context and create a custom hook which we will only use in the context(no pun intended) of the provider.\

## Potential Improvements

There are some improvements I would definitely like to make and I very well might in a few hours:\
-Fixing the Colors for dark Mode\
-add a custom icon+ change current icons to a more expansive icon pack.\

## Final Question

I notice my code strucutre is triangular in the sense that a parent has many children components. Lets say AppLayout > MainLayout > SeardchbarWithButtons > BasicSearchbar.... is this a problem?\
Should i be coding in a manner where I limit the amount of children components if possible? Talk more ab this on call...\

### Assessment Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Design Fidelity**: How closely the implemented UI matches the Figma design.
- **Use of ChakraUI**: Proper usage of ChakraUI components and styling system.
- **Code Quality**: Adherence to modularity, SOLID principles, and DRY principle.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Clarity and organization of the code.
- **Responsiveness**: How well the UI adapts to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile).

Grading (Performed by Steven & Bryan):
| Criteria                  | Score | Comments                                      |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Design Fidelity           | 8/10  | UI closely matches the Figma design, minor layout inconsistencies, overall negligible           |
| Use of ChakraUI           | 7/10  | Good use of ChakraUI components & inline styling. Some components could have been used (like Drawer) instead of manual implementations (no need to reinvent the wheel), would have also liked to have seen an extension of the ChakraUI theme in a `theme` or `styles` folder (https://v2.chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme)          |
| Code Quality              | 8/10  | Great modularity and adherence to DRY Principle. Some subtle SRP violations.     |
| Readability and Maintainability | 8/10  | Good organization overall & documentation. Some related components could have been grouped together in further subdirectories (e.g., Sidebar)              |
| Responsiveness            | 9/10  | UI adapts well to different screen sizes, Sidebar is a bit small on mobile      |

Overall Score: 40/50

### Additional Comments
Great work! The implementation is very close to the design, and the code quality is high-tier and what I would expect from an ambitious Junior Developer. The responsiveness is also well done. Some minor improvements could be made to the use of ChakraUI components and the organization of the components. Keep up the good work! ðŸš€

We look forward to setting up a call to discuss further and next steps.
